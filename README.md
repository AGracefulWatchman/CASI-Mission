Citizens Agency for Special Intelligence
Mission Statement



   The mission and purpose of the Citizens Agency for Special Intelligence (CASI) is to promote western civilization through the belief and support in a secular government, whose legal framework is informed by Judeo-Christian morals and ethic, and that of which origins lies in the Greco-Roman tradition of a Republic. From that basis we arrive to the ideology of constitutional republicanism, synonymous with federalism, nomocracy, nomology, the science of law, and freedom. We hold these truths to be self evident, universal, and applicable to all nations, although not well understood or upheld by most. 


   This organization was founded in response to the growing concerns that these truths which we hold are not being complied with. So we form to try to make a difference by collecting actionable intelligence which matters. To provide and gather public education by publishing documentation, as well as private databases. 



"... freedom of men under government is to have a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society, and made by the legislative power erected in it. A liberty to follow my own will in all things where that rule prescribes not, not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man, ..."
— John Locke, Second Treatise, Ch. 4 §21.
